# animated-plots

I saw a post today on Flowing Data about creating animated plots in R and decided to produce one of my own.

Inspiration from Flowing Data: http://flowingdata.com/2015/11/03/animated-pyramid-chart-in-r/

I may add to this in the future. For now it is just a simple script that creates overlapping distributions which repeatedly expand upward through the entire plot window.
